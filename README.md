# Huge List of Analyzed German .DE Domains (200,000+)

I analyzed about 200,000 German .DE domains. And I'm selling this list. But I also give a free demo (12,000 domains).

What does "Analyzed" mean?

Below you can see what my lists contain.

Main List:
1) 66k .DE domains.
2) No subdomains, only root domains (site.de).
3) Each domain has a category - business, education etc.
4) Each domain has an Authority Score.
5) Each domain has a Backlink Score (including Domains, IPs, Follow links, NoFollow links, Text links, Image links, Form links, Frame links).
6) Each domain has Traffic data (number of visitors per month). 

Important. All sites from this list have traffic and category. Sites without traffic I moved to bonus lists.
